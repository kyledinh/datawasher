## Project
> This project illustrates the use of Docker with Go to build a RESTful service to transform data. It provides a service through a simple container.

#### Technologies used
* Docker - https://www.docker.com/
* Go - https://golang.org/
* Gin Go Webserver - https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin

## Running the Docker container
In the `dist-linux` folder, there is the `datawasherLinux` server and support config and test files. To run this service as a container, just use:

In the `docker` folder.
```
linux-docker-build.sh
linux-docker-up.sh
```
## Using the datawasher services

### GET endpoints
These endpoints will return JSON objects
```
http://localhost:8000/random_contact
http://localhost:8000/contacts
```

### POST endpoints
This endpoint will transform POST a JSON payload of contacts and return the same payload with transformed first_names.

```
http://localhost:8000/json_contacts
```

See `testing/post-upload-contacts.sh` for a curl command to test the endpoint.

## Development

| Docker Dev Container                        |
|---------------------------------------------|
| `docker pull kyledinh/devlinux`             |
| `docker/launch-dev-container`               |

You will need to customize `docker/launch-dev-container` for where you place your source code and $GOPATH on your host:
* -v `/Users/kyle/src`:/opt/src
* -w "/opt/src/github.com/kyledinh/datawasher"

The `$GOPATH` is set to `/opt`. I would attach my host's GOPATH to this directory and set a volume to `/opt/src`.

* `kyledinh/devlinux` is built from this repo: https://github.com/kyledinh/docker/tree/master/images
